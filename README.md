# Child-vaccination_management-system
The Child Vaccination Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of tracking and managing vaccinations for children. The system aims to assist healthcare providers, parents, and government agencies in ensuring timely immunization, reducing missed vaccinations, and maintaining accurate medical records.

This system allows healthcare centers to register newborns and children, schedule vaccinations based on age-specific immunization schedules. It also stores the complete vaccination history of each child, which can be accessed securely by authorized personnel. Parents can track their child's vaccination progress through a user-friendly interface, reducing reliance on physical records.
